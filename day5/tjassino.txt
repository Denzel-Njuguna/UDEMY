1.binding to an ip and port - example being the user using a radio choosing the radio station 
2.server starts listening for connections- this is when the radio starts to broadcast
3.client connects to the server-then the radio tunes in
4.servers sends the requested information to the server-the user starts listening to music
5.finally the client disconnects from the server-this is when the listener turns off the radio

question 2:
user access and authentication
    i would implement a strong authentication and define the roles of users and their permissions
Network security
    i would put up a firewall to filter outgoing and incoming data
data protection and privacy
    i would encrypt sensitive data and control data access based on user's clearance
